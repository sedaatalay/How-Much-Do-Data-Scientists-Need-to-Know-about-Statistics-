# How-Much-Do-Data-Scientists-Need-to-Know-about-Statistics?


<p> </br>
Statistical analysis and probability affect our lives on a daily basis. Statistics are used to forecast the weather, restock retail shelves, forecast the state of the economy and much more. Used in a variety of professional fields, statistics has the power to gain valuable insights and solve complex problems in business, science and society. Without exact science, decision making is based on emotions and instinctive reactions. Statistics and data override intuition, inform decisions, and minimize risk and uncertainty.

In data science, statistics are at the center of complex machine learning algorithms that capture data patterns and turn them into actionable evidence. Data scientists use statistics to collect, review, analyze and draw conclusions from data and also apply quantified mathematical models to appropriate variables. Data scientists work as programmers, researchers, business managers and more. However, what all these fields have in common is the basis of statistics. Therefore, statistics in data science are as necessary as understanding programming languages.

In summary, it can be stated that Data science and statistics are indistinguishable and closely linked. It is clear that statistics is a tool or method for data science, while data science is a broad field where statistical method is an important component. Data science and statistics will continue to exist and there is a great deal of overlap between these two disciplines. Itâ€™s also worth noting that not all statisticians can be data scientists and vice versa. Data science has evolved with big data lately and will continue to grow in the years to come as data growth looks like it will never end.
